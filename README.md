# Sumarry
I haven't used any frameworks for this project, I used pure PHP v7.4.
I followed PSR2 code-style. I hope I followed it thoroughly since this is my first time using it.
On saturday night I realized that I've been doing everything wrong, so I re-wrote the whole project that night. I used cURL for contacting the API and to retrieve data from it. This project has pushed me out of my comfort zone. It didn't take long for this code, but for the previous, wrong one, it took me a whole week. Everything is tested and it should work properly :)
# Properties
Saddly I didn't finish the properties page. I didn't knew how to do it even though I am familiar with CRUD operations. I did one request though, and I outputted one title. I JSON Decoded the response from the API, put it in an array and after that I didn't know how to handle that array. How to list the array and how to use it.
